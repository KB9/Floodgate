# Floodgate
A cross-platform, 2D mobile game written in Java.
Uses libgdx and the Overlap2D level editor.

## Premise
In a series of hand-designed levels, place various blocks to prevent the rats being drowned when the floodgates open.

## Artwork
Currently looking for a graphics artist to continue this project. The core game logic is complete, the game simply requires art assets before it can be continued and polished up. If you are interested, send an email to kavanbickerstaff@gmail.com.
